  "I'm a full-stack web developer from Brisbane, Australia with a passion for learning and building new things. In the tech realm, I dance with TypeScript, serenade React, and juggle Redux among others like it's a circus act. But hey, I also like to keep it old school with some low-level C programming â€“ because who doesn't love a bit of nostalgia mixed with a touch of insanity? Currently, I'm on a quest to conquer the world of Go during my spare moments.";

  "In my non-tech life, I'm a caffeine-fueled spider scaling rock climbing and bouldering walls, occasionally taking leisurely hikes. When I'm not pretending to be a human mountain goat, I'm a laid-back soccer enthusiast, casually playing and passionately watching. As a film buff who almost became a film student, I opted for making sarcastic movie comments instead, I've settled for being a film buff, bringing my critical eye and love for the silver screen to every conversation. I'm just your friendly neighborhood tech guy, building and learning new things.";
/**
 * In the vast wilderness of my non-tech existence, I enjoy rock climbing and bouldering, like a spider on caffeine sometimes with the occasional hike thrown in for good measure.
 * When I'm not pretending to be a human mountain goat, I switch gears to the world of football (soccer)
